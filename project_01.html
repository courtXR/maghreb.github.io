                <!-- <h1>Research</h1> -->
                <p>In this project, my team and I were challenged to design a product that has a positive effect on society. During the brainstorming process, the problem we all seemed compelled to undertake was the increasing lack of in-person interaction, especially among young people. We all agreed that young people have become increasingly emotionally detached. Most young people prefer to interact with each other via social media or other electronic means of communication. The effect of this has caused them to develop behavior that would be frowned upon in-person but common on the internet. 
                    Since social media is the most popular means of communication among young people we decided to deconstruct it to understand its strengths and weaknesses. We wanted to understand why social media encourages this kind of behavior, why young people like it, and how we can endow in-person interaction with some of its more positive aspects or new ones to make it more appealing? 
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <p>During our analysis, we realized that complete or semi-anonymity and distance were factors that encouraged a more detached style of communication. However, both of these are necessary features of electronic communication technology. Without the immediate and visceral emotional feedback found within in-person or synchronous communication methods, emotional detachment is much easier. Interacting with someone in-person demands some level of empathy but communicating asynchronously or with a stranger miles away does not. 
                        We realized that engaging in more in-person interactions could counteract this effect, however encouraging young people to do so is much more challenging. We knew asking teens to quit social media would be impossible. So we decided to make in-person interactions more appealing instead. Inspired by the success of Snapchat filters, we chose to go one step further. We decided mixed reality would be the perfect technology to bring magic to everyday interactions. Teens enjoy the self-expression and the technology found on platforms like Snapchat and Instagram which allow them to do that in real-time. Mixed reality enables a user to see and interact with virtual objects as if they were in the real world.

                    <p>Mixed reality interactions are enabled by a pair of glasses worn by users. Users can create custom avatars which become how other users see them when wearing another pair of mixed reality glasses. These glasses also allow users to participate in games, activities, and other shared experiences. A bracelet worn with the glasses keeps track of time spent with friends and others and rewards point to the user. These points are used to purchase new accessories to customize your avatar and new games or experiences. Although this technology would make meeting up with friends more appealing it wouldn’t make teens more mindful of their behavior.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>We decided that a system that could give users feedback on certain behavior patterns could inspire a more mindful approach to interactions. The behavior patterns we chose to focus on were speech and mood. Using speech recognition technology, we could give teens feedback on how much of their speech was composed of words with negative associations and vice versa. This information is represented on a graph to encourage users to reflect on their behavior. Mood tracking technology acts as a log for users to record their mood throughout the week. Users will then be able to see when and where their mood reached low and high points and reflect on what caused this shift. 
                        This product seeks to rehabilitate teens who have become emotionally detached due to a reliance on social media connectivity and bring the magic back to in-person interactions.
