                        <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
                        <p>
                            Linked-up was the result of our IXD Studio 2 class project. The brief asked us to design a system of devices to solve the problem of decreasing in-person interaction among teens. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>PROBLEM</h4>
                        <p>
                            Young people are becoming more emotionally detached. Most young people prefer to interact with each other via social media or other electronic means of communication. The effect of this has caused them to develop behavior that would be frowned upon in-person but common on the internet. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>SOLUTION</h4>
                        <p>
                            Linked up is a mixed reality platform that allows teens to engage in immersive games and experiences, in-person, with friends to add a layer of magic to everyday interactions. We also incorporated a system that will give users feedback on certain behavior patterns to inspire a more mindful approach to interactions.

                <h1>Expert interview</h1>
                <p>From an interview with a highschool therapist, we found that most kids are drawn to social media because it allows them to interact with other kids their age and gives them the ability to express themselves in a creative way. The features of the most successful apps such as Snapchat and Instagram among kids include an interactive element, a communicative element, and the ability to customize an avatar or augment their appearance through the use of AR filters.
                    However, negative online interactions only exacerbate the lack of emotional intelligence development in teens instigated by their living environment. Many teens lack positive role models and emotional support in their community.

                <h1>Secondary Research</h1>
                <p>From our research we were inspired by a story of a kindergarten teacher who would designate a class greeter every morning. Each student who entered the classroom was able to specify how they wanted to be greeted. That greeting could be a handshake, a high five, or even a hug.
                    This got us thinking about how we could use technology to mediate positive interactions between teenagers. We also discovered many wearable devices which were designed to inspire mindfulness in its users. From there we started brainstorming on our idea.</p>

                    We decided to design 4 items: a pair of glasses, a bracelet, a ring, and a pendant.

                <h1>Testing</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>Our testing participant was a 12-year-old girl in middle school. We gave her a set of physical product mockups of wearable 
                        devices to try on and asked her some questions. She liked the idea of using wearable devices to connect with friends but 
                        felt restricted by being required to wear all the devices at once. She would much rather coordinate with her friends to wear 
                        one or a combination of the five devices on any given day.  Although she was unfamiliar with the technology previously she was 
                        thrilled at the idea of being able to customize an augmented reality avatar when the concept was shown to her. Although she did not 
                        have a history of antisocial behavior she was at least interested in the behavioral improvement features the device offered but was still confused as 
                        to how it worked. We hope that future iterations of this user test will solve this confusion.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>This project allowed us to think of possible uses for mixed reality and wearable devices to have a positive effect on human interaction. Aside from what was shown, this project involved many different skills including UI design for immersive experiences and prototyping in AR to name a few.</p>
